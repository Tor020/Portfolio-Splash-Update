self notes



The graphic choice in the bg is more evocative of an IT job than a dev job to me

I like the drab color scheme, not used to seeing that
Inconsistent spacing after "about" and "Technical Skills"


I think the four paragraphs of type could be a little massaged. I'd open up the line height and reduce the spacing between paragraphs.
Consider (Encapsulating) your tech skills into chunks. something to break up this wall of text

I'd actually find a much more fun way of displaying your skills. 
I am not impressed by your first two portfolio pieces if I was hiring for front end.
I'd pair down your code examples. Too many, not enough visual for me to understand your capabilities at a glance.

[3:37 PM] Skat ðŸ¦‘: so your shit ends up too tall
[3:37 PM] Skat ðŸ¦‘: calc(100vh - marginAmt)



: like i said thx 4 the feedback, i'll probably change the background image to be some fun shit on the canvas, a lot of the choices like the arrow and such were used because they made sense practically. Memorability is important but I'm more developer than designer. Practical smart UX and development choices are what i prioritize.
